    <img src="../images/seaweed-soup.jpg">

    <h3>Description</h3>
    
    <p>Korean seaweed soup (miyeok guk or miyuk guk, <strong>미역국</strong>) is a soup 
        predominantly made with sea mustard also known as brown seaweed 
        (undaria pinnatifida) or Japanese wakame.</p>

    <p>The soup is also typically accompanied with some form of protein 
        (e.g. beef, seafood - mussels or prawns, or tinned tuna) along 
        with light seasoning (salt, soy sauce, garlic and roasted sesame oil).</p>

    <ul>
        <li>15g dried seaweed</li>
        <li>120g beef chuck or round steak</li>
        <li>1/4 tp fine salt (or more to taste)</li>
        <li>A few cracks of black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>
        <li>5 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the dried seaweed in cold water for 5 to 10 minutes while 
            allowing it to expand. Drain the water away and rinse the seaweed 
            a couple of times in running water. Drain/squeeze the water out. 
            (If you're using non pre-cut dried seaweed, cut it with scissors - about 
            little finger lengths). Set it aside.</li>

        <li>Combine the sliced beef with the salt and black pepper in a small bowl. 
            Mix them well and set aside until needed.</li>
        
        <li>Pre heat a medium pot over medium heat (about 20 seconds). Add the sesame 
            oil, seaweed and beef. Stir them well until the beef is partly cooked 
            (about 2 mins). Add the soy sauce, garlic and water. Cover the pot and 
            boil over medium - medium high heat until the meat is fully cooked (10 
            to 15 mins). Adjust the taste with more salt if needed.</li>

        <li>Serve warm with a bowl of steamed rice and other Korean side dishes.</li>
    </ol>
